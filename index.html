                            <strong>CAS Project</strong></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Description: A student is required to do a CAS project that covers the three sections of CAS. These projects include community service that is established by the student and the IB Diploma class. CAS projects are created to be continued for next year’s IB group of students and following. Instead of one act of service, the student creates an opportunity that will last longer.<br><br>Project: In the Fall of 2022, the IB seniors were involved with a nonprofit organization called Creative Visions. Creative Visions encourages using your creativity to become an activist and create change in the world. Two of the team members, Miriam Scott and Sierra Doxey, came to our school every Wednesday to help us get started on our project. We were able to collaborate with other students in our IB group to create the project. I worked with Benjamin Zhang to create a website that promoted awareness about equal education. Our website contained info about the issue, written articles about the different aspects of education inequality, and a section where you can donate or volunteer to help contribute to reducing the issue. I had a great time working with Benjamin because we were able to form a project that would help students in need of help with their education, including those in our school district. Additionally, we could also pass the website down to the next IB group to continue updating the website and add more to it. I felt that working with Creative Visions really helped myself and the other IB seniors with our CAS project and gave me some insight into the severity of education inequality. Working with Creative Visions would definitely help the next group of IB seniors if they are struggling to figure out what to do for their CAS project.<br></p>

Instead of sitting around all day, I found some origami papers in my room and started making cranes and boxes out of it. My personal favorite animal I made out of origami was a dragon because it came out great despite the extensive steps it took to fold each corner and side. I gave some to my sister and we made tons of origami. I found it calming and relaxing to fold paper into various shapes and sizes and it kept my mind off of what was going on with the world.<br></p>

I was bored out of my mind one afternoon and got the bright idea to make a kite from scratch. I researched it on YouTube and it didn’t look too difficult. My dog and I set out to make the kite and honestly, it wasn’t too complicated. However, the true success would be flying the kite. Who knew flying a kite would be so difficult! My kite flew in the air for about 5 seconds after many many failed attempts. Even though my kite was not successful, I enjoyed the company (my dog) while taking on this task.<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 display-7">Towards the end of the pandemic, my family and I headed out to LA to go watch the play, Hamilton, at the Pantages theater with some of my mom’s friends’ families. This was my 1st time watching the play in-person. I was excited and worried about it at the same time because Hamilton is one of the best plays in the world, but I didn’t want to contract COVID afterwards. I enjoyed listening to the songs and watching how the story develops a historical timeline through a musical. Out of all the plays I watched with my family, this was my #1 on my list. Watching it in-person was very different from watching it on TV, as you could feel the emotions and sounds of the play. I had a great time spending time with my family watching Hamilton and I wouldn’t mind doing it again.<br></p>

One of the biggest events for the church is the annual Obon Festival where food, games, and crafts are set up over a weekend in July and the community comes together to celebrate Japanese culture. The highlights of the festival are the taiko drum performance and the odon dances. I was very proud of my sister for doing something that I wouldn’t do when I was her age. I enjoyed listening to the songs they played at the festival and watching my sister and the other performers proudly put on a performance for the crowd. <br></p>

On our 1st day in Toronto, the hotel room my family stayed in had an amazing view of the CN Tower and the buildings. My sister and I took several pictures of the view and the CN Tower itself before going back down to explore the city. After coming back to the hotel room to get ready for bed, the view from our room at night was even better because you could see all the night lights and the CN Tower flashed the colors of the rainbow. I continued to take more pictures from our hotel room and got some amazing pictures out of it. I was extremely satisfied with how each picture came out and I proudly set the photos as the wallpaper on my phone.&nbsp;</p>

We visited many of the Smithsonian museums including the Natural History Museum and American History Museum. One of my favorite museums we visited was the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, specifically the One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection. We walked through 5 different rooms which showcased her creativity and style. The rooms focused on optics and interactive elements of mirrors with different size dots. It was amazing to see her vision and I tried as best as I could to capture her vision and my feelings but I know I didn’t do it justice. </p>

There were several things we needed to separate ourselves from each other. My partner, Savannah, and I had to get creative with our “red carpet” walk to impress the crowd and steal their votes. We had a whole routine down and I felt that our intro walk was the best out of homecoming court. Even though I was reluctant at first to be part of homecoming court, it was one of the best experiences in my high school career and I was grateful to be part of it.</p>

                            I have been playing basketball since the age of 5. I wasn’t the most out-going kid and didn’t want to try any new activities. My parents didn’t let me quit and I am grateful for all their efforts. I am fortunate to have been part of Norwalk Youth Sports Kings since the second grade with Coach Masa Lau, Coach Kelly Kikuta, and my teammates who have become my brothers. We are completing our final season together and I am thankful for the time we have spent together on and off the court. Playing basketball has been one of the most impactful things in my life and has greatly contributed to my growth as a person.

Yes, you heard it, I didn’t know how to ride a bike until about 2 years ago. I learned how to ride a bike because my friends and I were only allowed to hangout outside. My friends planned to ride their bikes from Cerritos to Seal Beach and then hang out at the beach. On my first ride, almost everything went wrong because I almost crashed into another biker going the opposite direction, and my bike slid across the sand, making me fall and I nearly ate it. I had a lot of fun hanging out with my friends even though it got hot and tiring from biking from Seal Beach and back. We took many bike trips to the beach during COVID and I am grateful for the pandemic because it forced me to learn how to ride a bike. We all have cars and are able to drive to the beach now, but I think it would be fun to do the bike trip again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                            One of the must visit places while visiting Toronto was Niagara Falls. I am a huge fan of The Office and I wanted to check out the scene where Jim and Pam get married aboard the Niagara Falls boat. I don’t know what I was expecting but it was basically like taking a shower with the biggest and strongest shower head in the world. I could barely open my eyes and almost got knocked off my feet. We wore rain ponchos but still got drenched. The whole experience was pretty epic and something I will never forget.

Since there were many electric scooters around the area, we all took one and rode to each memorial with our scooters. It was a fun way to explore all the sights in D.C. and I could just speed around the area with no restrictions. I was so excited about riding a scooter that I fell and scraped my hands and knees trying to grab one before someone else did. I would love to go back to D.C again and zoom around the area on my electric scooter.<br><br>Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, US Capitol Building, Jefferson Memorial, WWII Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Memorial, Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial</p>

                            During Spring Break of my senior year, my family drove up to Mammoth to go snowboarding. This would only be my 2nd time snowboarding, and the 1st time I went snowboarding was in Brian Head, Utah. I was very rusty and fell several times the 1st day we went on the slopes. Fortunately, I got the hang of it and was able to go down the slopes with little to no falls. By the end of our trip, my legs were dead and I was tired after only 2 days of snowboarding. I had a great time snowboarding with my family and would absolutely love to go again with my friends.

Walk the Farm is a yearly event where families and friends are invited to “walk the farm” to enjoy farm-grown fruits and vegetables and cultural performances. The event raises money to help rebuild farms affected by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and central California farms suffering from natural disasters.&nbsp;<br></p>

I helped package dry food and produce into boxes to deliver to hungry families around Southern California. My family and I also had the opportunity to help at the Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County where fresh vegetables were grown to be included in the boxes. We spent time clearing the fields for new seedlings and harvested vegetables such as zucchini and green beans.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                            I started volunteering at the La Habra Children’s Museum as the COVID restrictions were lifted in the city. It was a little scary to be out around so many people at first but overall it was a positive experience for me. La Habra Children's Museum has several exhibits for kids to explore in a hands-on environment. Some of the exhibits include carousel room, train gallery, farm room, Kids on Stage, STEAM Lab. My volunteer duties included cleaning museum displays, preparing for museum activities, and running carousel rides. I did a lot of cleaning and it was a good way to tackle the anxieties of being in public at the end of the pandemic.

                                            I started volunteering as a NYS Rascals Youth Coach because it is where I learned how to play basketball at 5 years old. I want the young players to have the same positive experience. I thought it would be easy to be a youth coach but it wasn’t. I found that I needed to apply the same approaches that I learned as a player by building a connection and earning the trust of the young players through exhibiting patience and a welcoming attitude. When working with reluctant players, I pull them aside and talk to them about the things they like, such as their favorite food. I found that talking to young players about their favorite things lowers their stress level and their favorites can be a reward if they choose to participate. During our drills, I keep an eye on them to make sure that they aren’t feeling scared or anxious and are engaging in the fun. I really enjoy working with young players and will continue to do so as much as I can even after graduation.

                                            During the years I have been part of the Southeast Japanese School and Community Center’s Norwalk Youth Sports Kings, I have volunteered at many of the center’s activities including  Pancake Breakfasts, event set-ups, Obon Festivals, and the Rascals Clinic. My personal favorite event is the Obon Festival because it is a time to stuff my face with the best fried wontons in the world, take my chance at the Donation Ball Booth, and enjoy the festivities with family and friends. In addition to enjoying time at the festival, my teammates and I always make time to volunteer at the game booths. This last year, we helped with the plinko game and it was busy! Kids lined up to try their hands on the game, it was another fun and memorable activity at the center.
